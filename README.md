# sensd

> Ignite your hardware

`sensd` is a comprehensive Rust library designed to facilitate the management of sensor data.
It provides a robust framework for handling, publishing, and triggering actions based on sensor
data. 

Originally designed with a specific focus on building environmental control systems for scientific applications, `sensd` is a
robust framework for managing sensor data makes it ideal for handling the complex and precise requirements of such systems,
where accurate data collection, processing, and response are crucial. However, the modular and flexible design of `sensd` extends
its utility beyond just scientific applications. Its ability to handle, publish, and trigger actions based on sensor data,
coupled with its custom error handling and helper functions, makes it a versatile tool for any application that deals with
complex sensor data. Whether it's for home automation, industrial monitoring, or environmental sensing, `sensd` provides a
comprehensive solution for sensor data management.

## Why Sensd?

- **Dynamic**: `sensd` is built with Rust, a language known for its performance and safety. It's designed to handle complex sensor
  data logging and control system tasks with ease.

- **Versatile**: `sensd` can manage a wide range of sensor types and data formats. Whether you're working with temperature sensors,
  motion detectors, or custom hardware, `sensd` is will become your go-to solution.

- **User-Friendly**: `sensd` provides a simple, intuitive API. Even if you're new to Rust or sensor data management, you'll find
  the library easy to navigate.

- **Well-Documented**: Every function and module in Sensd is thoroughly documented. You'll never be left guessing about what a piece
  of code does.

## Getting Started

To start using Sensd, simply add it to your `Cargo.toml`:
